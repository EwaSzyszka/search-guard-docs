# Search Guard Kibana Plugin 6.x-16

**Release Date: 20.11.2018**

## Security Fixes

* Fixed possible open-redirect on login page when basePath is an empty string
  * [https://github.com/floragunncom/search-guard-kibana-plugin/pull/140](https://github.com/floragunncom/search-guard-kibana-plugin/pull/140){:target="_blank"}
  * [CVE-2018-20698](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20698){:target="_blank"}

## Fixes

* Fix infinite redirect by introducing a loadbalancer URL
  * If a basepath is set, but Kibana was accessed directly (i.e. not using a proxy), the login page would end up in an infinite redirect loop
  * If a loadbalancer URL is set in kibana.yml, Search Guard wouls redirect to this URL, avoiding the infinite redirect

  * Search Guard would falsely return a security exception for certain calls to the .kibana index
